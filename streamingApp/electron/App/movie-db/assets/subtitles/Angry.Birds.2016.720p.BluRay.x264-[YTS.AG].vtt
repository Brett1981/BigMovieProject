"King"?

709
00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:33.768
You have shared with us the wonders

715
00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:48.045
A hundred years from now, everyone will ask,

716
00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:51.727
"How did the friendship between
the pigs and the birds start?"

717
00:29:51.920 --> 00:29:52.921
Who cares?

718
00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:54.047
- Oh, no.
-(CROWD GROANS)

719
00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:58.043

Hey, look, they destroyed more of the stuff
we worked hard to build.

725
00:30:09.560 --> 00:30:11.244
- But there's more!
- CHUCK: More?

726
00:30:11.320 --> 00:30:13.448
Has gravity gone haywire?

727
00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:15.329
No! Even better!

728
00:30:15.400 --> 00:30:18.529
Your friends, the pigs, proudly give you

Hold on a second.

733
00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:29.443
I thought there was only supposed to be
two of these guys.

734
00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:30.931
LEONARD: Squad goals!

735
00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.049

- ALL: Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!

But that's not all.

737
00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:38.086
Throwing things just got a whole lot easier.

738
00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:40.003
Say hello to

739
00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.684

741
00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:45.404
- I can't see. Wow!
- This is crazy!

742
00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:47.881
- Tired of carrying things from place to place?
- CROWD: Yeah!

743
00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:50.884
- Wish you could just get it there?
- CROWD: Yeah!

744
00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:52.371
- Well, now you can!
- CROWD: How?

745
00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:53.851
- Waiters, do me a favor.
- Huh?

746
00:30:53.920 --> 00:30:55.285
- Take the rest of the night off.
- Thank you.

747
00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:57.761
Hey, if you got the night off,
why don't you fix my house!

748

Yeah, it's the same guy. (CHUCKLES)

749
00:31:00.600 --> 00:31:04.605
Well, the slingshot
does it all in three easy steps.

- Flown in fresh!
-Me! Me! I want fruit!

754

that had their wings up?

Here we go!

2264
01:32:55.560 --> 01:32:59.770
<i>Hey, hey, you and me
Different as different can be</i>

2265
01:32:59.840 --> 01:33:02.081
<i>You like to rock, I like to roll</i>

2266
01:33:02.160 --> 01:33:04.162
<i>You take the high and I'll take the low</i>

2267

<i>Whoa, whoa-oh!</i>

2268
01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:12.162
<i>Whoa, whoa-oh!</i>

2269
01:33:12.600 --> 01:33:16.047
<i>Just some roughed-up desperados</i>

2270
01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:20.527
<i>Hanging tough through thick and thin</i>

2271
01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:24.841
<i>Kicking up dust wherever we go</i>

2272
01:33:25.680 --> 01:33:29.366
<i>I can see that you and me
are gonna be friends</i>

2273
01:33:30.040 --> 01:33:33.931
<i>To the end, you and me are gonna be friends</i>

2274
01:33:34.480 --> 01:33:38.280
<i>I can see that you and me
are gonna be friends</i>

2275

<i>Yeah!</i>
